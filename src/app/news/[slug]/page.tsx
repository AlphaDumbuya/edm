        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">The heart of EDM beats with a passion for evangelism. We are driven by the words of Romans 10:13-15: "For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent?" This is why EDM exists â€“ to be sent, to preach, and to see lives transformed by the Gospel in Sierra Leone.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-4 text-foreground">Our Mandate and Motivation</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">Our commitment to evangelism stems from a deep understanding of God's love and the urgency of the Great Commission. We believe that every person deserves the opportunity to hear the life-changing message of Jesus Christ. Our efforts are not confined to church walls; we actively go out into communities, marketplaces, and villages, employing various methods, including open-air meetings and showings of the "Jesus" film, to reach those who have not yet heard.</p>

          <figcaption class="text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2">Taking the Gospel to every corner of Sierra Leone.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">We see evangelism not as an event, but as a continuous lifestyle of sharing God's love. This involves building relationships, understanding the local culture, and presenting the Gospel in a way that is relevant and clear. Our Ohio partners play a crucial role in supporting these evangelistic endeavors through prayer, resources, and collaborative efforts.</p>

      content: `
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">At EDM, discipleship is more than just a program; it's the core of our mission to build a strong, vibrant church in Sierra Leone. We are guided by Matthew 28:18-20, where Jesus commands us not only to make disciples but to "teach them to observe all that I have commanded you." Our goal is to see new believers grow into mature followers of Christ, equipped to then train others.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-4 text-foreground">From Conversion to Maturity</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">We recognized a critical need for formal training structures to help new converts grow in their faith. It's not enough for someone to accept Christ; they need ongoing support, teaching, and mentorship to develop a deep, resilient faith. EDM's discipleship pathway focuses on foundational biblical truths, spiritual disciplines, and practical Christian living.</p>

We are now facing an urgent need to cover the customs clearance fees, totaling <strong>$3,500.00</strong>.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold my-4 text-foreground">Your Support is Critical</h2>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">Without clearing these items, our ability to conduct effective evangelism, show the "Jesus" film in remote areas, and support our discipleship programs will be significantly hampered. These tools are not luxuries but necessities for the work God has called us to.</p>
        <p class="mb-4 text-lg text-muted-foreground">We humbly appeal to our faithful partners in Sierra Leone, Ohio, and around the world to help us meet this urgent financial need. Any amount you can contribute will make a direct impact on getting these resources into the field.</p>
